      <p>When it comes to algorithms <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">Depth First Search
       (DFS)</a> is one of the first things students will be taught at university and it is a gateway for many other important 
      topics in Computer Science. It is an algorithm for searching or traversing Graph and Tree data structures just like
      its sibling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search">Breadth First Search (BFS)</a>.</p>

      <p className='instruction'>If you run the visualisation below you can see how it works - you can run it on example graphs, or alternatively 
      draw your own - add nodes by clicking on the canvas below and add edges by dragging from one node to another.</p>
